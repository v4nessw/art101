			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With this lab, the biggest challenge for us was figuring out how it would
						be best to present the tasks in the assignment. With the pseudocodes and then
						the actual codes in the Lab 4 index.html, it was a bit of a struggle to figure 
						out how Wes wanted us to present the lab tasks. Another challenge we faced was
						trying to come up with the everyday task to pseudocode. Although fairly simple in
						theory, to pseudocode a common task means having to think about all the little
						steps that go into completing it.

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't run into many problems with this assingment, as the instructions were
						all very straightforward. I struggled a little with inputting the pseudocode into
						Javascript, but I just followed Kareem's code as a reference, which helped me out 
						a lot. I also ran into an issue with formating my lists in my index.html. Originally,
						I had input the pseudocode for the everyday task under one list tag, but after seeing
						it on my local server, I realized that it wasn't formatted correctly. To solve that 
						problem, I put each of the bullet points in a new list tag.

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday Task</h3>
						<h4>How to make chocolate chip cookies:</h4>
							<li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees</li>
							<li>Take out all the ingredients: butter, sugar, flour, salt, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips</li>
							<li>Take out a bowl, a whisk, a baking sheet, and a spoon</li>
							<li>Melt the butter</li>
							<li>Add sugar to the melted butter</li>
							<li>Mix in one egg and the vanilla extract</li>
							<li>Add flour, baking soda, and salt to the mixture</li>
							<li>Once smoothly mixed, add in chocolate chips</li>
							<li>After the chocolate chips have been evenly folded in, take a spoon scoop out balls of cookie dough, and place them on the baking sheet</li>
							<li>Bake the cookies for 7-10 minutes</li>
					<h3>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game</h3>
						<h4>Rock-Paper-Scissors
						</h4>
							<li>Print the images of rocks, paper, and scissors
							</li>
							<li>Accept user input
							</li>
							<li>Have the computer randomly pick between rock, paper, or scissors
							</li>
							<li>Compare user input and computer choice
							</li>
							<li>Choose winner
							</li>
							<li>If it is a tie, the game restarts
							</li>
					<h3>Task 3: Turn pseudocode into comments </h3>
<pre>
	// Loop to checking if win condition is met
	// Print out each option: Rock, Paper, Scissors
	// Allow the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors
	// Allow computer randomly select Rock, Paper, or Scissors
	// If user and computer selected the same thing
	  // Restart Game
	//If they are different, choose the winner
	  // User selects rock and computer selects scissors
		// User wins
	  // User selects paper and computer selects rock
		// User wins
	  // User selects scissors and computer selects paper
		// User wins
	// If none of these conditions are met
	  // Computer wins
