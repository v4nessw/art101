                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p> The main problem that I ran into while working on this lab was
                        that no scrambled words would show up on my website after inputting
                        my name. I worked with my lab partner on this issue and ran a couple
                        of tests before figuring out what the issue was and then fixing it.
