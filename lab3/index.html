			<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We struggled with uploading the images and linking them to our 
						codes. After uploading the images, we had to figure out how to resize
						them. It is also a challenge to be coding together while neither of 
						us can see the other's screen, since we are on a call. It was difficult 
						for my partner and I because both of us are new to coding. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our main problems were with understanding how to do the specific codes
						and getting the codes to work. Small nuances in the words or spaces make 
						the difference when it comes to coding, and because we are both inexperienced
						coders, it made it more difficult for us. We worked through these problems by
						taking it step by step, talking things through, experimenting, and referring to
						the WesBot.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results of this lab were the new functions on our sites. As a result of this lab, my site now has
						a picture of myself, information about me, and links to the labs that we have worked on.
