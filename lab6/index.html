			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we were asked to make an array and object and learn how to
						reference them. We first had to do it in the console and then in the 
						JavaScript file for lab 6.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with Task 1 of the lab because I was unfamiliar
						with how to code in the console. I had to troubleshoot some errors
						that took me some time to figure out, but I was able to work through
						it with the help of someone else and using the internet. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p> I have included a picture of the JavaScript code that
							I did for this lab. I learned how better to work with
							arrays and objects in JavaScript.
						</p>
