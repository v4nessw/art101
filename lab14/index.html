                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p> My main problem with this lab was going through my old assignments
                        and revisiting issues that had stumped me previously. I went through
                        and worked on some smaller aesthetic problems I had, but those were so 
                        minor I decided not to include them. With Lab 12, it took a lot of experimenting
                        for me to figure out how to fix the issue that I had.
                    </p>

            <div id="results">
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p> Check the section below!
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div id="debugging">
                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <figure>
                        <img id="image1" src="./img/screenshot3.png"/>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                        <img id="image2" src="./img/screenshot2.png"/>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                        <img id="image3" src="./img/screenshot4.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p> Because my previous labs all accomplished what they were meant to do (at least to 
                the bare minimum), I decided to go back and fix up Lab 12. The main thing I wanted to
                debug was the appearance of the button and text input. Originally, the button was small 
                and had no text on it. This made it look strange and out of place. The text input was also
                too short for the whole sentence to be seen. These were the two aspects I wanted to fix.
                First, I gave the button some text, which I did in the html file (first image), this way the
                button would no longer be blank. I then used css to adjust the width and height of the button. 
                I played around with the numbers to get the button to the right size for the text. I did the
                same with the input. I used css to adjust the width of it so that all the text was visible.
