                    <p> I was confused as to how to get the code to work for the JavaScript.
                        Because I'm more unfamiliar with this process, I asked my lab partner
                        for help and he was able to guide me through the process of getting
                        the code to work. I had run into issues with incorrectly writing out
                        my JavaScript code, which was then fixed after I followed his example.
