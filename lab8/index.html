			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge for this lab was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks by
						uisng JavaScript and creating arrays on a console. This was to familiarize us with how 
						the concept of anonymous fucntions and callbacks works.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I had with this lab was figuring out the console part. As I have struggled
						with creating functions in consoles previously, I was struggling to figure out what exactly
						to do for this assignment. However, using the example provided and communicating with my lab
						partner, I  was able to solve the problem.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p> Below I have included an image of what the JavaScript code looks like. I am now a lot more
							familiar with functions in general but specifically the anonymous functions and callbacks we
							focused on here.
