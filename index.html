					<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
					<p>My name is Vanessa Wang and I'm currently a second-year at UCSC. I'm from the Los Angeles area, more specifically, a small city 
						called San Gabriel. I'm a Film and Digital Media major, and I'm very involved in a student film organization here on campus 
						called the Film Production Coalition. We make short films each quarter and I've been a part of this club my entire time here 
						in Santa Cruz! Some of my hobbies include writing, reading, playing with cats (I love cats), and hanging out with my friends!
						Other than that, I don't really do much. When I'm with my friends we love going out to eat, watching a movie or show together,
						or just wandering around. Overall, I wouldn't say I'm a super interesting person but I'm okay with that.
